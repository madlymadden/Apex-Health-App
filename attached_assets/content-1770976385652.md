Best workout tracking app

This is by far my favorite workout tracking app. You can tell that the creators work out themselves because they know how important it is to be able to label drop sets, failure sets, supersets, etc. It allows me to track everything I need. When if it’s been a while since I did an exercise I can easily take a look at my history.

Kept Me Accountable

I have been using this app since January. I love it. It’s the thing that had kept me in the gym this year because it helps me see results. I love how it syncs with my watch and I can input the weight and reps on my watch or phone. I appreciate that it supplies workouts for different splits so I don’t need to pay for a trainer. I love how it holds the last rep and weight from the previous time I did the exercise.

Really helpful illustrations

My focus now is on building functional strength to avoid injuries as I age. Coming back to lifting as an adult with moderate gym anxiety, the Hevy app has helped me track progress on my weights and allowed me to make intelligent choices about increasing the amount I’m lifting. I really appreciate the illustrations and animations that help me learn new movements.

## [FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS](https://www.hevyapp.com/use-cases/)

[Can I see a detailed breakdown of my training volume?](https://www.hevyapp.com/features/training-chart/)

Yes, head over to Set count per muscle group in the Statistics tab for a detailed breakdown of the number of sets you’ve done for each muscle group. All the data is displayed on a graph and you can filter and segment the information––for example, weekly from the last three months.

[Can I track my sets per muscle group from month to month?](https://www.hevyapp.com/features/training-chart/)

The simplest option is to open Set count per muscle in the Statistics tab and select Year or All time on the first filter and Month on the second. Select which muscles you want to see on the graph and monitor the training volume from month to month.

[Can I display training data from a custom date range?](https://www.hevyapp.com/features/training-chart/)

As of now, no. The muscle distribution chart allows you to load data from the last 30 days, three months, year, or since the start, with the latter two options being available for Hevy pro users ($2.99 monthly).

[Is the muscle distribution overview accurate if I use custom exercises?](https://www.hevyapp.com/features/training-chart/)

Yes. So long as you label the primary and secondary muscles when building custom exercises, the information presented will be accurate.

[Is this feature available on Hevy’s free plan?](https://www.hevyapp.com/features/training-chart/)

Yes. However, you can only load data from up to three months back.
